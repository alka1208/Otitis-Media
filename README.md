# Otitis-Media
Otitis Media (OM) represents a prevalent and potentially severe middle ear condition, primarily affecting children. Timely and accurate OM diagnosis is crucial for effective intervention. This study explores the application of  deep learning techniques to tympanic membrane (TM) images for precise OM detection.
Our dataset, sourced from AIIMS Raipur Hospital, comprises four distinct image categories: Chronic Otitis Media (COM), Earwax plug (EP), Myringosclerosis (MS) and normal TMs. Each category encompasses 40 meticulously selected images for training and 40 for testing. Binary and multi-class classification 3 layer models were developed and rigorously assessed using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score.
The binary classification models consistently demonstrated impressive accuracy, surpassing 89.90%, in distinguishing various Myringosclerosis from normal TMs. Furthermore, the multi-class classification model exhibited an overall accuracy of 93.73% for categorizing TMs into  COM, EP, MS and normal classes.
